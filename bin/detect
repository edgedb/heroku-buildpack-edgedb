	Application not supported by the EdgeDB buildpack.

	The EdgeDB buildpack is set on this application, but was unable to detect an
	edgedb.toml file. EdgeDB on Heroku requires an edgedb.toml file at the root
	of the directory structure. Run 'edgedb project init' in the project root to
	add an edgedb.toml file

	This directory has the following files:

	$(ls -1p "$1")
			
	If you are trying to deploy an application that doesn't use EdgeDB, you need
	to change the list of buildpacks set on your Heroku app using the 'heroku
	buildpacks' command.
